Let the games begin! The Comments Leaderboard ranks your top commentators in a way that's sure to spark competition throughout your community.

== Description ==

The [The Comments Leaderboard](https://kolakube.com/comments-leaderboard/) was carefully designed to add a new twist to rewarding the top commentators on your blog and create a more addicting comment experience for your readers.

Each month, the 5 most active commenters throughout your blog will be listed and ranked from most comments posted to the least.

...but simply ranking on the Leaderboard isn't enough.

The lower their rank, the less visible their name will appear on the Leaderboards beautiful color spectrum (tip: you can even set a custom color to match your theme).

For their name and website link to get maximum exposure, they must outrank the competition by posting the most comments.

The overall leader gets a medal next to their name at the top of the list for the highest amount of visibility and prestige throughout your community.

But sadly, there is no comfort at the top.

The total amount of comments each leader posted for the month is displayed next to their name, making it easy for other commenters to overtake the top spot.

The Comments Leaderboard is the perfect way to reward your most engaging readers and fits perfectly in your blog's sidebar. Simply drag the Widget into place, write a title and description text, pick a color and your blog is ready for some serious comment action.

Just remember, keep your posts quality and you will attract quality comments.
